# Unstructured-Data-Processing-and-Analysis----Lexical-Analysis-of-UK-Political-Speeches

We started with a set of transcripts of speeches given by Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May, including each of their maiden speeches to Parliament and speeches they have given to their respective party conferences in recent years.

First we examined our data.

- name of document 

- polarity

-subjectivity

- word count (without stop words) 

- most frequent term (word)

- frequency of most frequent word (normalised by the word count)
- term frequency of the most frequent word
- inverse document frequency of the most frequent word
- TF-IDF for the most frequent word
- Generate a term-document frequency matrix for all the speeches and report the shape of this matrix (i.e., the number of rows and columns).
- Use cosine distance to compute the pairwise distance between all pairs of docu- ments as represented in the term-document matrix you just created. 

Then we answer the research questions:

- what are the most frequently used terms/phrases in speeches of the two politicians in 2007?  Maybe it can also help us identify the topic of the speech! 



- which word was intensively used by the two politicians respectively during the year 2017 compared to the past years?  This question may help us identify what was  stressed a lot by the British politicians/parties in this particular year.
